[Motivations for project](https:/http://buildacell.io/engineering/images/Figure1.png)

**Top-down approach**: Starting from entire existing genomes, genes are systematically removed and the genome is refactored until a cell with some minimal subset of components is created. The goal is to progressively obtain a deeper understanding of cells by characterizing essential components that remain. While this method could quickly provide an engineering platform, maximum potential knowledge gained is limited by a lack of first-principles design exploration.

**Bottom-up approach**: Starting from first principles, atoms or small groups of atoms (molecules) are put together in an intentional manner to create a protocell. The goal is to create a cellular recipe of well-characterized, essential components. While this method would likely lead to the most powerful understanding of cells, current technologies do not provide sufficient engineering capabilities and are slow to scale.

**Build a cell approach**. A top-down approach is taken to obtain a genome-less container while a bottom-up approach is taken to design lineage-agnostic genomes. Combining the two paradigms enables the design and understanding of genomes from first-principles without simultaneous concern for the remaining cellular components needed to instantiate the genome.
