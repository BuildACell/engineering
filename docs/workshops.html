<p>One lab wil not build a live cell. Engineering life requires collaborative effort of groups working on the problem from many diferent angles.<br> To truly collaborate and unite our efforts, twice a year our community meets for one-day workshop. We compare notes, check progress on projects and discuss problems. </p>
