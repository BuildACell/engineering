<p>[Build-a-cell] Workshop #4 and NSF Idea Machine submission</p>
<p>10/15/2018</p>
<p>
Dear Build-a-Cell members and sympathizers;<br> 
<br> 
The Build-a-Cell workshop #4 will be hosted by J Craig Venter Institute in February 8 2019.<br> 
http://buildacell.io/engineering/workshop4/<br> 
As before, the workshop will be 1 day long, with optional social activities the night before. <br> 
<br> 
NSF 2026 Idea Machine<br> 
We will submit proposal for the  NSF 2026 Idea Machine competition.
The entire submitting team has to be US based, so we will send the entry from the Build-a-Cell steering team. We would, however, like the proposal to be representing thoughts of most of our community.<br> 
Here is the draft of the submission we are preparing:<br> 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KzXAb_tss6h3og85Zbz8OKHR7v5jVLmf8lDmV243aII/edit?usp=sharing
Please give your comments and suggestions. Especially, please let us know what is missing.
The deadline is October 26.<br> 
<br> 
Best,<br> 
Kate<br>
