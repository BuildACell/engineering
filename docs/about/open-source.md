Build-A-Cell is open source, in code, in DNA, and in cells. Feel free to reuse, remix, derive and distribute. Commercial cell chassis require onerous material transfer agreements, and even free-to-use cell lines and plasmids can be hard to source free of restrictions. By using the Open MTA and distributing through the BioNet, Build-A-Cell tools and cells are unencumbered for everyone.
