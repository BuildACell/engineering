<b>Proposed boot sequence.</b> We propose a generative approach for organizing module development towards a dividing cell. As a first pass, we have considered a subset of the core functions necessary to make an empty container grow and divide once the synthetic genome has been inserted. Like the biokernel, the boot sequence may be adapted, optimized, and added to by the build-a-cell community as better and more efficient solutions emerge. The power module (module zero) instantiates the functionality necessary to replenish the basic energy, cofactor, and building block dependencies for subsequent modules. The production module (module one) establishes the necessary molecular machinery to make proteins. The control module (module two) provides the necessary machinery to precisely control expression of the synthetic genome. The homeostasis module (module three) outputs the cellular machinery responsible for maintaining the intracellular environment. The growth module (module four) instantiates the functions necessary for membrane growth in preparation for the final module that completes the self-replication process, the replication module (module five). Together these modules comprise the boot sequence.
