What if an _E. coli_ cell was the size of the Shriram building at Stanford? If 1 Âµm = 100 m, we calculate the size of a few biological objects.

## Sizes

| Object | Size |
|:---------:|:--------:|
| Bp | 3.4 cm
| H2O | 2.75 cm
| GFP | 30 cm
| Ribosome | 200 cm
| bilayer | 40 cm
| T7 | 580 cm
| mRNA | ~30 m
| Genome | 158 km

## Rates
At the same size scale, we can calculate how fast various cellular components would be moving:

| Process | Rate (m/s) |
|:---------:|:--------:|
| RNAP | 1.7
| DNAP | 3.4
