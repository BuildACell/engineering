<p><b>WORKING GROUPS </b></p>
<p> In addition to the below listed groups, we welcome suggestions for in situ formation of new working groups after the general discussion.</p>

<p><b>(4) Impact, policy, funding, milestones group</b><br>
Beginner's guide to Build-a-Cell<br>
For people who are not part of the community yet, also for non-researchers, funders, journalists<br>
How can we unify the field? What challenges will the synthetic cell field face: funding, research policy, biosafety and biosecurity<br>
Milestones, points of concern (running through the previously composed milestones paper draft will be good primer for non-specialists)<br>
Lead: kate<br>

 </p>

<p><b>(1) Interlab Group </b><br>
A list of potential components/subsystems that have already been demonstrated in isolation by differently and could be potentially integrated together in a "synthetic cell” to demonstrate some interesting function.  Output is diagram showing the components and some made-up graphs showing what we think we could demonstrate.<br>
A list of individuals/groups who can produce models for the components/subsystem and one or more groups who agree to develop a simulation of the integrated system, establish design guidelines for experiments to follow, and predict the results of those experiments.  Target date for first output from the model is 3 months.<br>
A list of individuals/groups who will produce experimental constructs (DNA sequences and/or DNA provided under OpenMTA) for each of the components/subsystems.  Components should be made available to anyone who is interested within the next 3 months.<br>
A list of individuals/groups will will receive the constructs and attempt to integrate them into a synthetic cell performing some interesting function, measure characteristics that correspond to the modeling/prediction results.  Target date for first attempt is 6 months.<br>

 </p>

<p><b>(2) PURE that makes PURE/better translation group</b><br>
 self-replicating translation systems, making and upgrading cell-free protein expression extracts <br>
Expected outcome: white paper review? list of problems that need to be solved to obtain self-replicating PURE<br>

 </p>

<p><b>(3) In silico cell group</b><br>
 Software for modelling and simulation of synthetic cell metabolism, transport, signaling and circuits<br>
Expected outcome (Aug 2018): list of available codes and protocols, list of needs for inputs and wishes for outputs, start dedicated Git.<br>
 Put together a v0.1 simulation of a synthetic cell that has whatever functionality we can muster.<br>
