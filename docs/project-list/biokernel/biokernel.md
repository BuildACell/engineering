        <div class="panel-body">The biokernel is the genome and associated biomolecules that comprise a molecularly defined cell that can be computationally simulated. It will possess the core components and functions necessary for an organism and developed and constructed in a manner to form the basis in which designers can construct arbitrary organisms of desired function.
For this to be achieved, we believe it will require a genome encoding a cell in which all biomolecules that are produced are accounted for, operational understanding of the functionality of each biomolecule, and a comprehensive model of their abundancies and positions over time.</div>

				<p> Construction of a semi-synthetic cell, or the design of a synthetic genome encoding and operating within biomolecules derived from natural organisms, is the most technically approachable path towards the goal of a molecularly defined simulatable cell. </p>
				<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/engineering/images/in vitro.png" width = "850"></p>
				<p> The prototyping platform to validate modules involve the design of chosen genes encoding the production of biomolecules to perform functions, building and integrating those genetic constructs and reconstituted cytosol, and testing them in a defined background while taking the requisite measurements to inform the next design cycle. </p>

		<p>PURE is a reconstituted expression system (mostly from E. coli) developed by <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v19/n8/full/nbt0801_751.html">Ueda et al. in 2001</a>. It contains all the purified components required to generate a polypeptide sequence from a DNA template. Its composition provides a <strong>defined</strong> background to drive consistent expression and can be used as the fundamental basis for building out into a cell.</p>
