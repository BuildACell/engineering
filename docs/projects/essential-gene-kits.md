title: Essential Gene Kits
---

Building a cell requires an understanding of which genes (and combinations of genes) are essential for an organism to survive. Numerous efforts have identified these gene sets for different organisms, however many remain uncharacterized. We plan to distribute open source kitsets of these genes to facilitate characterization of proteins, testing of essential gene circuits, validation of essentiality, and remixing.

# JCVI-Syn3.0
Hutchinson, et al (2016) minimized and synthesized the genome of *Mycoplasma mycoides* to create JCVI-Syn3.0. The JCVI-Syn3.0 gene set is a validated set of 473 interoperable genes essential for life, including the 149 genes annoted as having unknown function. In Stanford's BIOE 80 Introduction to Bioengineering class, 164 undergraduates designed DNA constructs for all genes in the JCVI-Syn3.0 genome (see [Building a synthetic cell with 164 undergraduates](https://osf.io/yxwpa/) for further details).

We are synthesizing the complete set of designed constructs for release under the [OpenMTA](https://biobricks.org/openmta/) in a standardized and open distribution vector. The gene library will be available through the [BioNet](https://biobricks.org/bionet/) and other means.

We hope that this library will facilitate the understanding of the unknown genes in the JCVI-Syn3.0 set through
