## What
We are developing a bacteriophage based system to insert or remove a gene or genes into a genome.

## Why
This tool will be useful for part, device, circuit or module knockout/knockin based development.

## How
A Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) / CRISPR associated (Cas) 9 system packaged into bacteriophage.

## What Is Success
A scalable platform for simultaneously knocking out multiple genes in a single cell.
