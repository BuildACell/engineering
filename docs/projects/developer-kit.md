Our developer kit consists of an open-source and freely-redistributable toolkit comprised of software tools, biological materials, and supporting materials. The kit will ship to anyone who is interested in contributing to the Build-A-Cell project under the [OpenMTA](https://biobricks.org/openmta/).
