## What
We are developing a whole genome conjugation system to serve as a physical analog to the `git merge`.

## Why
We envision this tool being useful for merging modules and versions with the biokernel.

## How
This system is based on a modified version of Conjugative Assembly Genome Engineering (CAGE).

## What Is Success

A rapid, reliable and scalable way of merging modules and biokernel versions.
