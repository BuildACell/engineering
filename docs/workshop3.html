<h2>Workshop plan</h2>
<p><b>Please bring your laptop.</b> Most of the workshop activities will involve editing shared online documents.</p>  

<p><b>Working groups.</b> The workshop will focus on few specific issues, considered in working groups. <br> We would like to have specific, tangible outcomes at the end of the workshop. </p>      
<p>We will have discussion about each of the topics prior to the workshop, on dedicated Slack channels. Join our Slack channel by <a href="http://buildacell-invite.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">getting an invite.</a></p>  
<p> 1.<b> Roadmap</b>: writing a review/roadmap paper, describing approaches and pathways towards building synthetic cell. To be published after the workshop.<br>
expected outcome: rough draft of a paper, ready for presubmission inquiry and further polishing<br>

 Minneapolis - St Paul Airport (MSP) has <a href="https://www.mspairport.com/directions/ground-transportation/light-rail-transit" target="_blank">direct public transportation link </a> to the UMn East Bank campus. You need to take <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/blue-line-map">Blue line</a> from the airport in the direction of Downtown (Target Field), then at US Bank Stadium stop switch to a <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/metro-green-line" target="_blank">Green line</a> train in the direction of Union Depot. Get off at East Bank stop (unless you're staying at a hotel down the street, in which case Stadium Village might be your stop).<br>
