<p><b>DIRECTIONS to the campus from the airport</b> <br>
 Minneapolis - St Paul Airport (MSP) has <a href="https://www.mspairport.com/directions/ground-transportation/light-rail-transit" target="_blank">direct public transportation link </a> to the UMn East Bank campus. You need to take <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/blue-line-map">Blue line</a> from the airport in the direction of Downtown (Target Field), then at US Bank Stadium stop switch to a <a href="https://www.metrotransit.org/metro-green-line" target="_blank">Green line</a> train in the direction of Union Depot. Get off at East Bank stop (unless you're staying at a hotel down the street, in which case Stadium Village might be your stop).<br>

    Uber should be equally quick option except at ruch hour, when it  might actually be faster to take the train.  </p>
