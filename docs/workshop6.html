<p><b>WORKING GROUPS </b></p>
<p> In addition to the below listed groups, we welcome suggestions for in situ formation of new working groups after the general discussion.</p>

<p><b>LifeOS group</b><br>
 Building an operating system for life.<br>

 </p>

<p><b>Interlab Group </b><br>
A list of potential components/subsystems that have already been demonstrated in isolation by differently and could be potentially integrated together in a "synthetic cell” to demonstrate some interesting function.  Output is diagram showing the components and some made-up graphs showing what we think we could demonstrate.<br>

 </p>

<p><b>PURE that makes PURE/better translation group</b><br>
Self-replicating translation systems, making and upgrading cell-free protein expression extracts <br>
Expected outcome: white paper review? list of problems that need to be solved to obtain self-replicating PURE<br>

 </p>

<p><b>In silico cell group</b><br>
 Software for modelling and simulation of synthetic cell metabolism, transport, signaling and circuits<br>
Expected outcome (Aug 2018): list of available codes and protocols, list of needs for inputs and wishes for outputs, start dedicated Git.<br>
 Put together a v0.1 simulation of a synthetic cell that has whatever functionality we can muster.<br>
