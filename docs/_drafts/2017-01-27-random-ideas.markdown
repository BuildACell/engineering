* Could we build an *E. coli* devleopment chassis that has 'triggerable replication', so that we can grow up a culture then arrest replication, preventing it from confounding DNA-manipulation experiments.
* REXER implemented with restriction enzyme sites on the homology sequence ends so that the homology reason can be easily switched out without having to resynthesize the guide RNA to cut it out.
